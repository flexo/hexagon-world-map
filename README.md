# hexagon-world-map
An SVG rendering of the world with each country asigned an equal-area hexagon.

I'm roughly keeping this as countries that are members of the UN in their own right, and have no doubt accidentally left some off or made a stinker with some country placements. Please let me know / pull requests welcome!
